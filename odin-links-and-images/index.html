<!-- rel refers to the behavior the original page should do about the new one (tab or window) -->
<!-- "noopener" ensures that the new page cant make changes on the previous one.  -->
<!-- Some JavaScrpt code could do it. What represents a security threat! -->

<!-- noreferrer: The noreferrer attribute provides both privacy and security. 
 It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) 
 cand also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original page. -->
